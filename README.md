# [![Onix Client Logo](https://github.com/notJudahRR/OnixClientFaq/blob/main/onixlogosmall.png?raw=true)](https://discord.gg/OnixClient) Onix Client FAQ

Onix Client is the best client for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Sometimes, however, you may need help setting it up, and this is what this is for. This has all of the common questions about Onix Client, instillation, and usage. If you have any suggestions for this page, please fork this repository, edit it, and then create a pull request. Finally, if you have any other questions please join the Discord server and create a ticket there.

## 📪 Where can I download Onix Client?

To download the Onix Client go to the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) channel. Once you do this you have a few options.

### Launcher (recommended option)
- Download the launcher and open it. Then, hit launch and in a few seconds it will be automatically injected into your game. Then, your done!

### Injector & DLL
- Use the Onix Injector and download the DLL. Select the DLL. Then, launch Minecraft and go back into the injector. Once, Minecraft loads click Inject.
- You can use a third-party injector but we cannot ensure that it will work properly and it is safe for public use.

## 🔒 Is Onix Client safe?

Yes, we can assure that Onix Client is 100% safe for use. Your antivirus might flag it because it injects a DLL into the game. However, due note these things:
- Our injector can only inject into Minecraft, other viruses attack other applications, if not all.
- If you use any third-party program along with our DLL, we are **NOT** ensuring functionality or the fact that this is safe. However, any Onix Client file used is 100% safe.
- If you ever feel like anything is not safe, **DON'T** use it.

## 📱 What devices does Onix Client support?

### You have to use Windows 10/11. You also need the 64-bit operating system with a x64-based processor.

To find out whether you can use Onix Client or not check this out:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/140582244-70a847bf-a2fb-41dc-ae0c-320090bbf23e.png)
- If it says "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you can use Onix Client.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows. We will not be showing you how to do that here, so go do your own research.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, ***x86***-based processor", unfortunately, you can't use Onix Client.
- If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use Onix Client either.

### We have no plan to support any other device other than Windows 10/11. Please do not ask, it is just annoying and people may be toxic to you.

## 🌊 When I open the client, I get a error saying: "You are attempting to open a file of type 'system file'", why does this happen?

This is because you are trying to open the DLL, which only works with other injectors. The dll file cannot be opened and is not meant to be either. If you want to use this method please check out the Onix injector. Due, note if you use a third-party injector, we are not responsible for anything that may happen. Read more [here](https://github.com/HugoNotHere/OnixClientFaq/blob/main/README.md#-where-can-i-download-onix-client).

## 🔧 Can I turn off or customize the "OnixClient on top!" splash text?

No, this is to tell whether Onix client has been injected properly. If this does not show up a few seconds after injecting the client, then you know something is wrong, and it wasn't done right. This feature is mainly just for testing and support purposes.

## 🐞 When I inject, my game crashes. Why does this happen?

Your game is probably in a version that Onix Client does not support. If you are below 1.16.40, you will need to upgrade to higher version. If you are below, the latest supported version, you will need to downgrade. You can find a great version switcher [here](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher)! To check if you are using a verison Onix Client supports make sure you can find your version in this list:

```
1.18.2
1.18.1
1.18.0
1.17.41
1.17.40
1.17.34
1.17.32
1.17.30
1.17.11
1.17.10
1.17.2
1.17.0
1.16.221
1.16.220
1.16.210
1.16.201
1.16.200
1.16.100
1.16.101
1.16.40
```

## 🧥 Why does it say "as nobody (HOW)" on Discord instead of my Gamertag?

If this is happening make sure you have the Xbox Console Companion, which you can download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-console-companion/9wzdncrfjbd8#activetab=pivot:overviewtab). Log in, and it should show up after restarting Onix Client.

If you have already downloaded Xbox Console Companion, log out and log back in. This should fix it.

## 🏢 Architecture Error
![Architecture Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139365553-b57f8306-24de-4b1d-b0c8-5ff4b5fc9c95.png)

If this shows up, you probably have a 32-bit version of Minecraft. This is usually branded under FPS Boosting or Lag Free AppX files. However, this is not compatible with Onix Client.

## ⛔ Unsupported Version
![Unsupported Version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139366307-d319f1ea-36c3-4978-b8ba-ad3cd891141e.png)

You have a version of Minecraft that is not supported, you can see this list of supported versions [here](https://github.com/notJudahRR/OnixClientFaq#-when-i-inject-my-game-crashes-why-does-this-happen).

## 💉 Injection Error
![Injection Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139366443-21a01000-36c3-44a0-842e-30030bdf31d5.png)

An error occured while trying to inject Onix Client. This may be due to your anti-virus, however, we cannot quite pinpoint this issue to a cause. Please open a ticket if you have issues resolving this problem.

## 🎨 How can I get Onix UI?

You can download the Onix UI [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833457218040758272/884252116355526726/onixui.mcpack). This was made by rice#2532 (aka Riceexe), thank you very much. This will be the same and will never have any updates in the future. If you use the UI in 1.17+, the pause menu might break. Use this [pack](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/814260749232898058/842613971751665704/PauseMenuFixByRice.mcpack), as it will fix it. This was also made by rice.

## 💰 How can I support Onix and the client?

You can support us by [becoming a patron](https://www.patreon.com/onixclient). The perks are listed in the tiers. If you buy a tier, please don't hesitate to open a ticket to get your roles if the bot hasn't already synced them.

## 🌈 Why are my rainbow modules not synced/in time with each other?

Open chat, and type in ```.syncrainbow```, hit Enter. This should sync the modules together.

## 🔎 Why is the zoom not working with my hotkey?

Right click the module first (you can do this with any module to enable it). This is not a bug, but a feature that allows Onix to have a zoom out animation if you have zoom animations enabled.

## 🖼️ I want pictures of the Onix Launcher and Injector!

![Onix injector/launcher example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/deebd779f5e2e830636e2d8c7e51a29f4110cfc75f5a7ec0b1915587738b7854/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3738353931303732353439393432303639362f3838303834323334323736373136313336342f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e67)
![Onix injector/launcher example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64127681/139374739-a69c085f-ce7b-4e17-93d6-0cfdd6437d0f.png)

## 🧪 Why don't the PotionHUD icons show up?

One of your texture packs, probably broke them. But don't worry, we have a PotionHUD Fixer [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852320290750726145/874753455418388550/PotionFix.mcpack)! Due note: this pack may break custom hotbars/XP bars.

## ⚠️ Why does the Onix launcher/injector give me a .NET Framework error when I open it?

Make sure both the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) and [Visual C](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) runtimes are installed, then try to reopen it.

## 🛏️ When I have render options on, I can't see beds and chests and other blocks.

Turn off "Hide Tile Entities".

## 🖌️ How do I change the theme of my Onix GUI?

Say ```.theme``` in chat to reveal the theme editor. To share themes, go to your Onix Client folder and find the file called ```theme.txt```. To use a theme made by someone else, make sure Minecraft is closed, then delete the ```theme.txt``` file from the Onix folder (```%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\OnixClient\```) and replace it with your desired theme. There isn't a theme manager like the config one (.config) and there probably never will be because Onix doesn't want to make it.

## 💜 How do I reset a color/module?

Middle click the change color button or the module in the Onix GUI. You can middle click by pressing the scroll wheel down, or clicking with 3 fingers on a trackpad.

## 🔻 How do I remove the red arrow from minecraft?

Download [this pack](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kqyjo9s9ld39nkn/No+Red+Arrow+by+Mhavin.mcpack/file) and apply it. The reason why it exists is because the pack maker/porter of one of your packs never updated hud_screen.json. The bug report and discussion can be found [here](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105882).

![Red Arrow Bug](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/611f29fa85267ae8044cf1a3238a2afb2383d681bb7bbdf31c1a2f646c7d4f43/68747470733a2f2f696d616765732d6578742d312e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f65787465726e616c2f5861544a716e464b70546d5676705a527349556a69625272533143684442386e5a434a473078756b4c33452f68747470732f6875676f2e706c656173652d656e642e6d652f6f67702f35386e4d69557748642e706e67)

## 🦠 My antivirus blocks the client.

Depending on the antivirus that you're using, you should either turn it off so you can download the client or you can exclude the client from being flagged. Onix Client is not a virus of any sort. The launcher is open source; the source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/notcarlton/OnixLauncher) if you want to compile it yourself or check if the code is safe.

### Info for Avira users
Avira will not let you use Onix Client, even if it's disabled. We recommend you uninstall Avira until we get this issue sorted out with them.

If you have an antivirus that's not included here or if a link stops working, DM me [@ItzHugo#2308](https://discord.com/users/731013984710426694) so I can fix it.
