# Onix Client FAQ

[Join the Onix Discord for support and the latest downloads for the client.](https://discord.gg/onixclient)

## Requirements:
### Dependencies and prerequisited required to use this Client:
1. brain

## The most common questions:
### Will there ever be support for *x* device?
- Onix is not supported on anything other than windows 10/11 64 bit currently. If you ask for/suggest it, people will most likely be toxic to you.

### When I open the client, I get a error saying: "You are attempting to open a file of type 'system file'", why does this happen?
- You downloaded the Onix Client DLL, which is only for use with other injectors. If you don't know what a DLL file is, **don't use it**. You should download the injector or the launcher from the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) channel, and click "Launch" or "Inject" to use the client. If you want to use Onix with another injector, you may use it. It is not needed for the Onix injectors/launchers as they auto download the DLL.

### When I opened the Onix launcher, nothing happens. Why is this the case?
- Currently, there is a bug with the main launcher. For now, use the launcher in the [#public-beta](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/764114686139826196) channel.

### My anti virus says Onix is malware. Is this true?
- We can assure you that Onix client is safe. It gets marked as a virus because it injects a DLL into a process. Lots of viruses do the same thing for malicious purposes.
- Onix only injects 1 DLL into 1 process (the Onix DLL -> Minecraft), while DLL injection based viruses inject into every program.

### Is there a way to change/turn off the custom "OnixClient on top!" splash text?
- No, because it's so people know the client is injected properly. It's also useful for support reasons if a person in need of help shows a screenshot of their game.

### When I inject, my game crashes. Why does this happen?
- Your game most likely updated to a version that Onix Client does not currently support. You might also be using an older DLL with the "Custom DLL" option enabled in the launcher/injector. If both of these potential causes aren't the case, you can ask for support on our Discord, either by asking in [#community-support](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/832745413916360806) or [making a support ticket.](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/814277715594838087/892132983065161829) **Please state as much details as possible.**

## How do I get the Onix UI?
[Download it here.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833457218040758272/884252116355526726/onixui.mcpack) Thanks to rice#2532 (aka Riceexe) for stealing HJN's ui.
```
THE UI IS BEING GIVEN AS IS. THERE WILL BE NO UPDATES, NO BUG FIXES, AND NO SUPPORT.
```

Using the UI on versions 1.17 and above will break the pause menu. You can fix this by putting the [pause menu fixer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/814260749232898058/842613971751665704/PauseMenuFixByRice.mcpack) on top of your active packs, which is also made by Rice.

## If you have any questions, problems, or bugs that you would like to report, you can go over to [#community-support](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/832745413916360806) or [#make-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/814277715594838087) on our Discord server.

# **How can I support the client?**
- You can support us by [becoming a patron.](https://www.patreon.com/onixclient) The perks are listed in the tiers. If you buy a tier, please don't hesitate to open a ticket to get your roles if the bot hasn't already synced them.

# **How do I download the client?**
- Head over to [#download](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/852334369061863464) and download the launcher. If the launcher doesn't work, try using another injector listed. 
- [Fate Injector](https://github.com/fligger/FateInjector/releases/latest/download/FateInjector.exe), if none of the launchers and injectors worked for you.
   
### **Why are my rainbow modules not synced/in time with each other?**
- Say `.syncrainbow` in chat.

### **Why is the zoom not working with my hotkey?**
Right click the module first (you can do this with any module to enable it). This is not a bug, but a feature that allows Onix to have a zoom out animation if you have zoom animations enabled.

### **How do I remove the client?**
Hold CTRL + L.

### **Why is there no DLL in #download?**
This is mostly because there is a major bug with one of the modules that *will* crash your game. You can always find the DLL on GitHub if you need it that badly: https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onixclientautoupdate/blob/main/OnixClient.dll?raw=true.

### **Why don't the Potion HUD icons show?**
- One of your packs most likely removed them. Download the hotfix pack [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852320290750726145/874753455418388550/PotionFix.mcpack) and put it at the top of your pack list. This pack may break custom hotbars/XP bars, as it uses the same layer as them.

### **Why does the Onix launcher/injector give me a .net framework error when I open it?**
- Make sure both the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) and [Visual C](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) runtimes are installed, then try to reopen it.

### **When I have render options on, I can't see beds and chests and other blocks.**
- You turned on "Hide Tile Entities".

### **How do I change the theme of my Onix GUI?**
- Say ``.theme`` in chat to reveal the theme editor. To share themes, go to your Onix Client folder and find the file called ``theme.txt``. To use a theme made by someone else, make sure Minecraft is closed, then delete the ``theme.txt`` file from the Onix folder (``%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\OnixClient\``) and replace it with your desired theme. There isn't a theme manager like the config one (.config) and there probably never will be because Onix doesn't want to make it.



### **How do I reset a color/module?**
-Middle click the change color button or the module in the Onix GUI. You can middle click by pressing the scroll wheel down, or clicking with 3 fingers on a trackpad.


### How do I remove the red arrow from minecraft?

Download [this pack](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kqyjo9s9ld39nkn/No+Red+Arrow+by+Mhavin.mcpack/file) 
and apply it. The reason why it exists is because the pack maker/porter of one of your packs never updated hud_screen.json. [The bug report and discussion can be found here.](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105882)
