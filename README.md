# Onix Client FAQ

[Join the onix discord for support, downloads and chats with the other 65k members.](https://dsc.gg/onix-client)

## Non questions:
### Will there ever be x device supported support??
- onix is not supported on anything other then windows 10/11 64 bit currently, if you ask/suggest for it, people will most likely be toxic to you.

### When I open the client I get a error saying You are attempting to open a file of type "system file", why does this happen??
- You don't open the onix dll, if you don't know what a dll is, don't use it. All you need to do is open the launcher/injector and click launch/inject then join a world or a server and click L on your keyboard. If you wanna use onix with another injector you may use it but it is not needed for the onix injectors/launchers as they auto download it.

### When I try to open the onix launcher nothing happens, why does this happen??
- There is a bug with the main launcher, to fix this use the launcher in the [#public-beta](https://discord.com/channels/814195071356370977/764114686139826196). **Note: The file in the channel is called and is also said to be an injector but it's really just the onix laucher**

### My anti virus says onix is a virus. Is this true??
- It's a false positive, onix is safe. It says this because it injects a dll into a proccess and lots of viruses do the same thing for malicious purposes.

### Is there a way to change/turn off the custom "onix client on top" splash text?
- No, it's useful so people know the client is injected properly and it's also useful for support reasons if they show a screenshot of their game.

### When I inject my game crashes, why does this happen?
- You are most likely using an older dll, turn off custom dll or use the newest one, if you are not, ask for support on our discord **and please slate as much details as posible.**

## How do I get the onix ui??

Also on 1.17 the pause menu will be bugged, you can fix it by putting the [pause menu fixer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/814260749232898058/842613971751665704/PauseMenuFixByRice.mcpack) at the top of your active packs, which is also made by Rice (lol).

### **Why is there no DLLs in #download Just injectors/launchers?**
This is mostly because there is a bug with one of the modules that needs fixing and it will crash you lots. You can always find the dll on the github if you need it that badly: [download](https://github.com/bernarddesfosse/onixclientautoupdate/blob/main/OnixClient.dll?raw=true).



### **Why are the screenshots I take with onix black?**
- The screenshot function is broken. uwp apps have lost perms for ``app capture services`` so blame windows. For your screenshots not to be black you need minecraft installed in debug mode (don't ask me how). I recommend clicking unbind/selecting a key you don't click much for the screenshot hotkey if it shows black for you, as it can be annoying.



### **Why don't the potion hud icons show?**
- Your pack is most likely removing them, download the hotfix pack [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852320290750726145/874753455418388550/PotionFix.mcpack) and put it at the top of your pack list. Note this pack may break custom hotbars/xp bars as it uses the same layer as them.



### **Why does the onix launcher/injector give me a .net framework error when I open it?**
- Make sure both of these are installed: [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) the ``runtime`` one & [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). Then try to reopen it.



### **Why when I have render options on I can't see beds and chests and other blocks?**
- This is because you have ``hide tile entities`` turned on. Title entity (also known as block entity) is extra data associated with a block. On bedrock they are called blockActor but more people are familiar to how java calls them: TileEntity.



### **How do I change the theme of my onix gui?**
- Do ``.theme`` in chat. To share themes go to your onix client folder and there is a file called ``theme.txt``. To change theme with a premade theme have minecraft closed then delete the ``theme.txt`` from your folder then save the new one in the folder with the file name ``theme.txt`` and reopen minecraft and it should have loaded. At this time there is not a theme manager like the config one (.config) and there probably won't be because onix doesn't wanna make it.



### **How do I reset a color/module?**
-Middle click (by clicking the scroll wheel directly down) the change color button or the module in the onix gui.


### How to remove the red arrow from minecraft?

Download [this pack](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kqyjo9s9ld39nkn/No+Red+Arrow+by+Mhavin.mcpack/file) 
and apply it. The reason why it exists is because the pack maker/porter never updated hud_screen.json. [The bug report and discussion is found here.](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105882)
